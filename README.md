<h2><a href="https://github.com/chris-kesler/SNHU_CS-320_Junit-Testing">Contact Service Classes:  JUnit Tests (Java) on GitHub</a></h2>

<p>
A group of Java classes and comprehensive Junit test cases that ensure class attributes abide by the specifications.
</p>

<h3>Description</h3>
<p>
This is a series of Java classes with various attributes that were designed around the specifications of the client.  There are three types of classes, each with constructors, getters, and setters as appropriate.  Each class type also has a corresponding Service class, which is designed to handle instances of the base class in a list format with a scaling ID number.  The classes communicate with each other in a variety of complex ways, and I incorporated JUnit tests that comprehensively ensure all interactions are handled properly.  Each of the six classes have a corresponding Junit test file, which have been run as coverage tests throughout development to ensure comprehensive testing is present.  The JUnit testing is thorough, offering multiple types of input and verifying expected behavior, both in nominal and exceptional cases.  The JUnit tests have been verified to cover all relevant lines of code with nearly 100% coverage project wide.

<h3>Getting Started</h3>
<h4>Dependencies</h4>
<ul>
<li>
Windows 10* || <a href='https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10'>Link to Download Windows</a>
</li>
<li>
Eclipse IDE for Java Developers 2021-12 || <a href='https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/release/2021-03/r/eclipse-ide-java-developers'>Link to Download Eclipse</a>
</li>
<li>
JUnit 4 Library || <a href='https://qualitestgroup.com/insights/technical-hub/how-to-set-up-junit-in-eclipse/'>Setup Guide</a>
</li>
</ul>
<p><i>*potentially not required, but it is what I used and therefore know for certain works</i></p>

<h4>Installing</h4>
<ul>
<li>
Download the Project Files from the SNHU_CS-320_JUnit-Testing Repository on GitHub || <a href='https://github.com/chris-kesler/SNHU_CS-320_Junit-Testing'>Link to Repository</a>
</li>
<li>
Cloning the Repository via Git is ideal, but downloading a zip and extracting it will also work || <a href='https://git-scm.com/downloads'>Link to Download Git</a>
</li>
</ul>

<h4>Executing Program</h4>
<ul>
<li>You can create a new Java project in Eclipse using existing project files, create an empty project and move the project files into the new directory, manually, or create an empty project and clone directly to that folder using Git</li>
<li>Compile and Build the project; there should be no errors</li>
<li>Right click on the Test folder under src > contact > services and select "Run as Coverage Tests"</li>
<li>The Coverage tab will highlight the lines of code that were executed in green, while the lines that were not executed will be highlighted in red</li>
</ul>

<h3>Help</h3>
<p>
Most of the issues I ran into with this program involve setting up the JUnit library and getting the first tests laid out.  This video goes over JUnit in Eclipse and general setup, which I found helpful.  The information I found most relevant starts at the 9:00 timestamp.
