A group of Java classes and comprehensive Junit test cases

These files were part of my Computer Science program at Southern New Hampshire University.  There are three types of classes, each with constructors, getters, and setters as appropriate.  Each class type also has a *Service class, which is designed to handle instances of the base class in a list format with a scaling ID number.  Each of these six files have a corresponding Junit test file, which have been run as coverage tests to ensure comprehensive testing is present.
